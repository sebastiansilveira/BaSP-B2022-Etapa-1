            <p>In 2021, a journey began in Montevideo, Uruguay. Fulanito Mengano Rodriguez, our beloved
                CEO and founder of the company, noticed the business he worked for could use some help 
                and started giving out Excel sheets to his fellow teammates in order to manage their 
                teams effieciently. Eventually, it became a business idea on it's own.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, we have been striving to help improve our customers productivity rates,
                branching out into software solutions of all kinds. Our patented strategies and 
                diversiry of layour sheets have enabled us to reach over 150 companies in the span of 6
                months, granting us the title of Fastest Growing Company of 2022 in the Trackhahon Awards
                for companies in the field of Logistics.
